Key Points of this project

This project is made with very simplistic UI which is very easy to understand and navigate for the user. The main highlight is the Custom made image picker, which allows the user to either pick from all images of from images that are of 1:1 aspect ratio, i.e square shaped images.

This project uses some third party dependencies which are as follows:

1. Alamofire -> To make Networking calls, fetch and post data.
2. SwiftyJSON -> An easy and simple way to parse and manage JSON Responses.
3. SDWebImage -> To load images from Url's and save them in cache memory for easy and fast access.
